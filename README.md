# ClimMappings
A collection of mappings, control vocabularies to use with climate science data and tools

The idea is to have one place where we can collect, review, update and offer in different formats, controlled vocabularies, mappings and other table style data used by the Australian climate community. The aim is to improve user experience by promoting the adoption of the same terms and definition whenever possible. It will also help data and code producers by reducing duplication of work.

! Work in progress

Feel free to contribute relevant material and ideas on how to structure the repo via issues.
